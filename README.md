# Long text summarization by intergating lexrank method and RNN based deeplearning model

This project aims at integrating Lexrank algorithm and RNN based encoder decoder model for long text summarization. 
Initially performs sentence level clustering to group similar sentences. The proposed algorithm uses reccurent neural network approach 
combined with attention mechanism to generate summary for each clusters. Later lexrank algorithm is used to identify relevent sentences to form the final summary.
